    <h1>Riya,</h1>

    <p>
I wanted to write this calmly.
<br><br>
Doesn’t matter how things ended, I’m grateful for what we shared. I am not sure if you were able to see the happiness inside me when I was with you in person or on phone calls or on video calls(the happy ones).
<br><br><br>
Things didn’t work out. We both made mistakes, and I’m aware of my own. I hope you’re aware of yours. <br><br><br> Yes, my reactions were always loud but what made them trigger? The truth is better known to you but I think with 2025 coming to end, your interest also came to an end. I think it all started with you not calling me at night and then giving other reasons. I am not very sure if I did make a mistake on 29th Dec when calling someone else late night actually started. 
<br><br>
I don’t want to reiterate anything or place blame on you or me. I think that you understand your side, just as I’ve taken time to understand mine.
<br><br><br>
I’m choosing to move forward silently now.
I’m choosing to start a new life with what I’ve learned.
<br><br><br>
This is my note of gratitude towards you. Although I know you don’t even want to read anything from my side.
<br><br><br>
For the very last time, I want to say I really loved you with all my heart and I really wished a partner like you.
<br><br>
Well, now, all my dreams have shattered with this end. Some dreams don’t come true, but they still change us. I am happily letting you go, not with anger, but with acceptance. I am closing our chapter with silence. I hope one day you will remember me without pain, same as I will try.
I will miss the version of us that once believed each other. Even now, part of me wishes things were different. This goodbye is heavy, but I am carrying it silently. I am walking away with a lot of feelings I cannot or maybe don't even want to explain.
<br><br><br>
After thinking a lot, I have noticed a pattern with both of my relationships now. Maybe I wasn’t really enough. Both lost interest in me in less than 6 months of time. Jaanta hun once it started, I reacted really loud which acted as a catalyst to lose this interest from your side, but I think the mistakes always needs to be fixed from the root cause and not just apply a patch. Anyways, Thanks a lot for your time and attention to this matter.
<br><br><br>
Peace. Best wishes. I'm not really expecting a response to this note and there is no pressure on you too to reply to me. I am just as fine with or without it.
<br><br><br>
Naman Goyal.
