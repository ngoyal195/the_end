    <h1>Riya,</h1>

    <p>
I wanted to write this calmly.
<br>
Doesn’t matter how things ended, I’m grateful for what we shared. I am not sure if you were able to see the happiness inside me when I was with you in person or on phone calls or on video calls(the happy ones).
<br>
Things didn’t work out. We both made mistakes, and I’m aware of my own. I hope you’re aware of yours.
<br>
I don’t want to reiterate anything or place blame on you or me. I think that you understand your side, just as I’ve taken time to understand mine.
<br><br>
I’m choosing to move forward silently now.
I’m choosing to start a new life with what I’ve learned.
<br><br>
This is my note of gratitude towards you. Although I know you don’t even want to read anything from my side.
<br>
For the very last time, I want to say I really loved you with all my heart and I really wished a partner like you, at-least if not you.
<br>
All my dreams have shattered with this end. Some dreams don’t come true, but they still change us. I am letting you go, not with anger, but with acceptance. I am closing this chapter silently, without any hate in my heart. I hope one day you will remember me without pain, same as I will try.
I will miss the version of us that once believed each other. Even now, part of me wishes things were different. This goodbye is heavy, but I am carrying it silently. I am walking away with a lot of feelings I cannot explain.
<br><br>
I will wait for one final call from you until 01/08/2026(Thursday) midnight in case you wanted to compromise on anything you want or not want. If in case not, I will consider everything to be closed on both sides.
<br><br>
Peace.
<br><br>
Naman Goyal.
